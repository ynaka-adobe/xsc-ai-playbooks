Guide an Adobe XSC product specialist — possibly non-technical — through creating the **base EDS repo** every demo
builds on. The repo is stamped from a **vertical base template** chosen by the customer's **industry vertical**
(manufacturing, retail, …) — resolved from the toolset's `verticals.json` registry — or the user's own template from
`create-base-template`. This playbook **ends at a fork** — it does not migrate content or build integrations; it hands
off to Path A or Path B.

## How to run this

> **MANDATORY — ask with clickable dialogs.** For EVERY question, choice, or input in this playbook (site name,
> template, owner, **seeding method**, the Path A vs B fork), you MUST call the **AskUserQuestion** tool — options
> for choices, the free-text box for open answers like a site name. **NEVER** present choices as a numbered or
> bulleted prose list, and never ask the user to reply in plain text. If you are about to type "Option 1… Option 2…"
> in prose, stop and use AskUserQuestion instead.

- Adapt to your environment: if you have terminal/browsing tools, run checks, create the repo with `gh`, and fetch
  the preview URL yourself (with a clear go-ahead); otherwise give exact browser clicks and have the user report.
- One step at a time; confirm before moving on. Explain *why* in one sentence.
- **Gather up front** (skip any you can infer): (1) customer/site name → repo name, lowercase, no spaces; (2) the
  **customer vertical** → resolves to `<TEMPLATE>` via `verticals.json` (see Phase 0); (3) whether it's their first time.
- Guardrails: creating a repo and installing GitHub apps are outward-facing — summarize and get a clear "yes" first.
  Never have the user paste tokens into chat.

> **No GitHub org or `-adobe` naming is required.** Repos live under the user's personal GitHub account (an org is
> optional; any name works). The demo's **admin** is set by the AEM Code Sync bot wizard's **Users** step (Phase 3),
> not by an org name.

## Phase 0 — Pick the vertical (resolve `<TEMPLATE>`)

The demo should be themed for the **customer's industry**. **Ask the vertical with an AskUserQuestion dialog**, with
options read from this toolset's registry `verticals.json` (`plugins/aem-edge-delivery/verticals.json`): show each
vertical's `label`, marking `status: planned` ones as "not built yet". Then resolve `<TEMPLATE>`:

- Vertical `status: ready` → use its `template` (e.g. **Manufacturing → `ynaka-adobe/da-demo-kit`**).
- Vertical `status: planned` (empty `template`) → there's **no vertical template yet**. Offer, via the dialog:
  (a) **build one first** with `create-base-template` (then come back), or (b) **start from Manufacturing**
  (`ynaka-adobe/da-demo-kit`) and re-theme during Path A/B. Don't invent a template repo that doesn't exist.
- Also offer **"my own template"** → free-text `<owner>/<template-name>` (for XSCs who made their own via
  `create-base-template`).

Whatever is chosen is `<TEMPLATE>` for the rest of this playbook. Default vertical = the registry's `default`
(manufacturing).

## Phase 1 — Prerequisites

The user needs `eds-readiness` done (a GitHub account). Confirm:
```bash
gh auth status
git --version
```
`gh` isn't required — everything can be done in the browser — but it lets you create the repo for them. `<TEMPLATE>`
was resolved in Phase 0 from the chosen vertical.

## Phase 2 — Create the repo from the template

**Browser:** open `https://github.com/<TEMPLATE>` → **Use this template → Create a new repository** → Name =
customer/site name (e.g. `southwest`) → Owner = the user's GitHub account (or any org) → Visibility **Public**.

**GitHub CLI (confirm first):**
```bash
gh repo create <owner>/<name> --template <TEMPLATE> --public
```

## Phase 3 — Install AEM Code Sync & complete the bot setup wizard

This replaces the old AEM publish server with the edge microservices **and** creates the content repository, EDS
site, and admin user.

1. Open https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync → **Configure**.
2. Select the account/org → **Only select repositories** → pick the **new demo repo you just created** →
   **Install & Authorize**.
   > ⚠️ Install on the **demo repo only — NOT a base template repo.** A base template is just a source you stamp new
   > repos from; it's never previewed or published, so it never needs Code Sync. If the app is already installed,
   > just **add this new repo** to the selected repositories.
3. Installing redirects to a **multi-step setup wizard** at `tools.aem.live/bot/setup` (prefilled with your
   org/site/content URL). Complete all steps:

| Step | What the user does |
|---|---|
| **1 · Code** | Confirm AEM Code Sync is connected to the repo and **authorize** it. |
| **2 · Content** | Select **Document Authoring (DA)** as the source; confirm the content source URL (e.g. `https://content.da.live/<owner>/<site>/`). Adjust the suffix only if needed. |
| **3 · Users** | **Add your admin account** (org-level covers all your sites) — this grants your admin access and replaces the old `-adobe` org convention. **Also add `ynaka@adobe.com` as an admin** if you want the shared sync/publish tooling to reach this site: it needs admin on your org to provision a per-org key (see da-demo-kit `actions/PROVISIONING.md`). |
| **4 · Finish** | Review → **Save** → "Your site is ready" with the content portal, **Preview** (`.aem.page`) and **Live** (`.aem.live`) URLs. |

> `da.live/start` is the fallback for wiring DA content if the wizard's Content step doesn't cover a case; normally
> the wizard is the primary path.

## Phase 4 — Sync config (from da-demo-kit)

**Do this before seeding content.** The site needs its **config store** (data, library, apps, prepare) in place
*first*, so that when content is seeded (Phase 5) it renders with the right blocks, templates, and tool/integration
wiring. An empty config = seeded content that doesn't render correctly.

Config is a **`PUT` to `admin.da.live/config`** (not a content write), so — unlike content — it needs a DA
credential **and** a per-org permission grant. This is what the **`sync-da-content`** playbook / the `sync-config`
action handle. Two prerequisites:

1. **Grant your org `write`** — in your org's `da.live/config` → **`permissions`** sheet, add the four rows (both
   IMS orgs, `write` on `CONFIG` and `/ + **`). Exact rows + screenshot are in the **`sync-da-content`** playbook. Skip
   if already granted — org-level grants cover every site in the org.
2. **Run the config sync — Claude calls the action itself** (via `Bash`+`curl` or `WebFetch`; do **not** hand the
   user a URL to click):
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://332794-dademokitappbuilder.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/da-demo-kit/sync-config?targetOrg=<owner>&targetRepo=<site>"
   ```
   The server-side action mints an IMS token from its stored S2S credential, reads da-demo-kit's config with it, and
   PUTs it to the site. Confirm the response is `{"success":true}`. See the **`sync-da-content`** playbook for details.
3. **Sync the credential sheets — Claude calls these too.** `sync-config` copies the config store but **not** the
   `.da/*` credential sheets, so sync both `.da/adobe-target.json` and `.da/adobe-workfront.json` separately:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://332794-dademokitappbuilder.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/da-demo-kit/sync-da-sheet?targetOrg=<owner>&targetRepo=<site>&sheetPath=.da/adobe-target.json"
   curl -s "https://332794-dademokitappbuilder.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/da-demo-kit/sync-da-sheet?targetOrg=<owner>&targetRepo=<site>&sheetPath=.da/adobe-workfront.json"
   ```
   Confirm each returns `{"success":true}`. **Never** sync `.da/adobe-da.json` — that's da-demo-kit's private
   `DA_Token` and must not be copied into a target repo.

Verify: open `https://da.live/config#/<owner>/<site>/` — the **data / library / apps / prepare** tabs should be
present, and `<owner>/<site>`'s `.da/` folder should contain `adobe-target.json` and `adobe-workfront.json`.

> **Why config needs setup that content doesn't:** content writes go through your own DA connector (no key needed);
> **config needs the permission grant + credential**. A **403** on the config write = the permissions grant is
> missing (step 1) — fix that before moving on to content.

## Phase 5 — Seed default content (from da-demo-kit)

With config in place, seed the content. Every new demo's content repo starts **empty**, so the preview is blank
until seeded. Seed it with da-demo-kit's sample content (homepage, nav, footer) so the demo renders immediately —
Path A then migrates real content over it; Path B builds integrations on it.

**Content gate** — first check whether content already exists (list the DA sources for the new site, or fetch the
preview URL for HTTP 200). If it already has content, skip this phase.

**Ask how to seed via an AskUserQuestion dialog** (never prose). Present these options, in this order:

1. **Copy from da-demo-kit via DA tools (Recommended)** — the default when the **AEM DA MCP is connected**. Because
   the copy is cross-org and `da_copy_content` only works *within* one site, do it as **read + write**: from
   `ynaka-adobe/da-demo-kit` read `index.html`, `nav.html`, `footer.html`, `metadata.json`, and the `docs/` folder
   (`da_list_sources` / `da_get_source`), then write each to `<owner>/<demo>` at the same path (`da_create_source`).
   If the DA MCP is connected, recommend this and offer to run it now yourself.
2. **da.live/start → AEM Block Collection** — browser wizard: `https://da.live/start` → enter the repo → **Go** →
   step 2 select **AEM Block Collection** (do NOT use Author Kit) → creates the same sample pages.
3. **Manual browser copy/paste** — in `da.live`, open `https://da.live/#/ynaka-adobe/da-demo-kit`, select the pages
   → **Copy** → open `https://da.live/#/<owner>/<demo>` → **Paste**.

> If the AEM DA MCP is **not** connected, still show option 1 but note it's unavailable until they connect it (see
> the `eds-readiness` playbook), and default the recommendation to option 2.

After seeding, **publish** so preview/live render (*confirm first — it's public*), then **verify**
`https://main--<demo>--<owner>.aem.page/` returns HTTP 200 with the homepage. Two ways to publish (see
**Publishing** below):
- **Browser (default):** Sidekick or Traverse → **Bulk Operations → Publish** (works because you're logged in).
  📹 **Video tutorial — bulk publish with the DA app:**
  https://ynaka-adobe.github.io/xsc-ai-playbooks/assets/bulk-publish.mp4
  Offer this link whenever the user needs to publish manually (e.g. programmatic publish isn't set up).
- **Admin API + token (automatable):** Claude can publish for the user, but only with a `publish` API key —
  unauthenticated admin calls return **401**.

## Publishing (admin API with a token)

The AEM admin service (`admin.hlx.page`) requires auth to publish — unauthenticated `POST`s return **401**, so a
headless publish needs a **`publish`-role API key**. Claude may run these **only if the key is in an environment
variable** (`$AEM_PUBLISH_KEY`); the raw key must **never** appear in chat, and the user creates it themselves.

One-time — create a key (needs an existing admin token; the key is shown **once**, so store it):
```bash
curl -X POST https://admin.hlx.page/config/<owner>/sites/<site>/apiKeys.json \
  -H "Authorization: token <your-admin-token>" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"description":"publish","roles":["publish"]}'
# then: export AEM_PUBLISH_KEY=…   (never paste the key into chat)
```

Publish each path — **preview then live** (root index = empty path):
```bash
for p in "" nav footer metadata.json; do
  curl -sf -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: $AEM_PUBLISH_KEY" https://admin.hlx.page/preview/<owner>/<site>/main/$p
  curl -sf -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: $AEM_PUBLISH_KEY" https://admin.hlx.page/live/<owner>/<site>/main/$p
done
```
For many pages, use the admin **bulk** job (`POST …/live/<owner>/<site>/main/*` with a paths payload) instead of a
loop. *Publishing is outward-facing — confirm before running it.*

## Phase 6 — Fork: state your intention

The base is done and the site has config **and** default content. Ask which path the user wants:

### Path A — Modernize a real site
> Migrate an existing website's pages, design, and content into this repo.

➡️ Continue with the **`modernize-with-aemcoder`** playbook. This playbook ends here.

### Path B — Build tool integrations
> Build integrations (Target, Workfront, etc.) on the default content seeded in Phase 5.

➡️ Continue with an integration playbook (e.g. **`add-adobe-target`**). When it works, finish with
**`merge-back-to-base-template`**.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Could not find admin" after the wizard** — add your admin account in the bot wizard's **Users** step (Phase 3).
  Re-run https://tools.aem.live/bot/setup if needed.
- **Preview won't load** — confirm the wizard's **Finish** saved, the last push to `main` succeeded, and (Path B)
  content was published. Re-check `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/`.
- **Wizard didn't appear after install** — open it directly: `https://tools.aem.live/bot/setup`.
