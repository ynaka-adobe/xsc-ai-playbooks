description: One-time environment setup before building AEM Edge Delivery (EDS) demos — checks git/Node/AEM CLI, guides creating a GitHub account, and confirms readiness, then recommends the next step. Use when someone says "get me set up", "readiness check", "set up my machine for EDS demos", "am I ready to build a demo", or is starting EDS demo work for the first time.

# EDS Demo Readiness

Guide an Adobe XSC product specialist — possibly non-technical — so their machine and accounts are ready to build
AEM Edge Delivery demos. This is **setup only**; building a demo is the `create-eds-repo` skill.

## How to run this

- **MANDATORY — ask with clickable dialogs.** You MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool for these and NEVER present a numbered/bulleted prose option list. Whenever you need input or a choice from the user, ask via a clickable
  AskUserQuestion dialog — use the free-text box for open answers (like a site name) and options for choices —
  instead of prose questions.
- Adapt to your environment: if you have terminal/file tools, run the version checks yourself and report ✅ / ❌.
  If you can't run commands, ask the user to run each and paste the output, then interpret it. Give the fix for
  anything missing.
- Go one section at a time and confirm before moving on. Keep language plain.
- The user creates their own GitHub account themselves — you guide, you don't do it for them. Never ask the user to
  paste passwords or tokens into chat.
- At the end, give a short ✅ readiness summary, then recommend the next skill based on intent (see step 4).

## 1. Check local tools

Run these and report ✅ / ❌ for each:
```bash
git --version
node --version
aem --version
```
Install anything missing:
- **Node.js** (includes npm) — LTS from https://nodejs.org
- **git** — https://git-scm.com
- **AEM CLI**: `sudo npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`

## 2. Create your GitHub account

1. Go to https://github.com → **Sign up**.
2. Create the account. Using the **Adobe email** is recommended for identity/attribution, but not required — GitHub
   emails a code to validate it.

> **No org or special naming needed.** Demo repos go directly under the personal GitHub account. The old
> `<username>-adobe` org convention is gone: the AEM Code Sync **setup bot** now lets you add your admin account
> directly (its **Users** step, in the `create-eds-repo` skill), which is what the org name used to be a workaround
> for. A GitHub org is optional; if used, any name works.

## 3. Connect the AEM DA content tools (recommended)

Connect the **AEM DA** MCP so Claude can read and seed **Document Authoring** content directly — e.g. copy default
content into a new demo, or seed a blank site — without manual browser steps.

- Server: **AEM DA - Prod** → `https://mcp.adobeaemcloud.com/adobe/mcp/da`
- Authenticate it via your **claude.ai connector settings** (or `/mcp` in an interactive Claude Code terminal).
  Claude can't run the sign-in flow for the user — direct them to do it.
- When it shows **connected**, the `da_*` tools (list / copy / create content) become available.

Optional but recommended: without it, content seeding falls back to the browser (`da.live`).

> **If the DA MCP is failing** (tools erroring, "server disconnected", or `da_*` calls hang): have the user
> **disconnect the AEM DA connector and reconnect it** — in their claude.ai connector settings (or `/mcp` in an
> interactive terminal) — then retry. A stale/expired connection is the usual cause.

## 4. Readiness check & next step

Confirm and summarize as a ✅ checklist:
- git, Node, and the AEM CLI are installed.
- A GitHub account exists (Adobe email recommended, not required).
- *(Recommended)* the AEM DA MCP is connected (for content seeding).

Then ask what the user wants to do next and recommend:
- **"I just want to build a demo"** (most people) → the **`create-eds-repo`** skill.
- **"I want my own reusable base template first"** → the **`create-base-template`** skill (one-time), then
  `create-eds-repo` for each demo.

> Rule of thumb: if unsure, go straight to `create-eds-repo` — you can always make a base template later.
